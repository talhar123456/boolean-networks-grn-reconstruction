# Boolean Networks and GRNs Reconstruction

## Repository Name

`boolean-networks-grn-reconstruction`

## Description

This repository contains Python tools for working with Boolean Networks and Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). It includes implementations for outlier detection using the Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate (GESD) test, Boolean Network simulations, and analysis of periodic orbits and attractors.

## Features

- **Outlier Detection:** Implement a robust outlier detection algorithm using the GESD method. 
- **Boolean Network Simulation:** Simulate Boolean Networks, enumerate initial states, and analyze state transitions.
- **Periodic Orbits Analysis:** Identify attractors and basins of attraction within Boolean Networks.
